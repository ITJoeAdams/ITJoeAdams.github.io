        <div id="research-interests">
            As a Ph.D. student, I do research in the field of theoretical computer science. 
            Though I have an interest in all areas of theory, thanks to my M.Sci in Computer Science at Birmingham, my main focus lies in type theory, univalent foundations, category theory, topology, and domain theory. 
            <br><br>
            My current work is looking at the exhaustible searchability of the Cantor space, an infinite space that can be completely searched in finite time. 
            As elements in a Cantor space are infinite sequences of 0s and 1s, we can check a predicate on elements one digit at a time.
            If the predicate holds for an element beginning with 0, we check the rest of the sequence; otherwise, we know it starts with 1, and check the rest of the sequence. 
            Eventually, thanks to uniform continuity, we reach a point where any sequences that start with the same `m` numbers will produce the same output, meaning we don't need to search the infinite sequence.
